# MyWarranties

Warranty Tracker is a beautifully designed and easy-to-use app built entirely with SwiftUI, designed to help you keep track of your warranties and receive timely reminders before they expire.

## Key Features

- Built with 100% SwiftUI: Enjoy a clean, modern, and responsive user interface crafted with Apple’s latest declarative framework.
- Core Data Integration: All your warranty information is securely stored on your device using Apple’s Core Data framework, ensuring reliability and privacy.

## Development Journey

This app started as a learning project inspired by Paul Hudson’s 100 Days of SwiftUI course. Since its inception, I’ve refined my knowledge and applied advanced SwiftUI techniques, making the app more robust, intuitive, and feature-rich.

Looking ahead, I plan to release exciting updates with improved features and new capabilities. Stay tuned!
